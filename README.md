# Wikipedia analyser

Project for #YRS2013

Uses neural network from [[github.com/jcla1/nn]]

Basically analyses wikipedia lexically and structurally to find things that need to be improved.
Uses a (self-written) neural-net for analysing structure and an ngram model to analyse the sentence fragments.
Built around a pipeline that enables it to be distributed across multiple CPU cores.
